                    If the main characters movie through time in a non-traditional way, they ended up on this list.
                    It is by no means an exhaustive list (there are only 14 titles here) but hopefully it is a <em>fun</em> list.

                    To be clear, I've only watched about half of these.
                    Some are recommendations from people, some are recommendations from the internet.

                    I feel like it is important to mention that while I might dive into movies sometimes to pick them apart, it's all in good fun.
                    I really just love movies, and when they don't make 100% sense or there is a fun alternate reading of it, all the better.

                <p> Also, I would like to mention a thing I didn't notice until my partner pointed it out; it's not Groundhog<strong>'s</strong> Day, it's just Groundhog Day.

                                    We all know and love <em>Groundhog Day</em> (except jackie who hates it).
                                    It's the tale of a jackass who learns how to pretend to be a good person when he got stuck in a time loop.
                                    Is he really a good person now, or did he just figure out how to be a deeply manipulative A-hole with a charming exterior.
                                    Who cares, <em>it's a movie</em>. Fun Fact: My partner went to college with the son of Stephen Tobolowsky (Ned)!

                                    This is one that, as of writing this, I haven't seen yet. Emilio suggested it iirc.
                                    From the trailer and a few reviews it seems like, what if <em>Groundhog Day</em> was about two people, and it was a vacation not a nightmere.
                                    Seems like a good premise, and Samberg is usually pretty funny. 
                                    I wonder if he throws anything on the ground.

                                    A time loop that slips into the "Indie" vibe. I haven't watched this one, internet suggestion.
                                    It looks pretty cute though,and unlike <em>Palm Springs</em> it's on a service I have.
                                    I like that this goes in the "both of them are in on it" direction.
                                    The lead couple seems to fall for each other as they decide to document all the perfect moments that happen in their loop.
                                    It definitely gives me that artistically distorted view of reality feeling from the trailer but not in the worst way.

                                    How much you like this might depend on if you can stand looking at Adam Devine's face.
                                    I'm pretty hot and cold on this kid's comedy <em>but</em> he honestly puts in a solid performance.
                                    It's a cute rom-com with a time loop, exactly what we're here for.
                                    This one is little bit <em>Groundhog Day</em> a little bit <em>Back to the Future</em>, as every time he goes back to a very specific Halloween night three years ago, he wakes up in a new present.
                                    Will he get the girl? Do these movies teach us that women are just objects men are entitled to? Watch to find out!
                                    Seriously though, it's cute and funny. I liked it.

                                    Another one I haven't seen and doesn't have <em>great</em> reviews <strong>but</strong> it does fit the mold.
                                    Time-loop Rom-Com. 
                                    Not entirely dissimilar to <em>When We First Met</em> (both in premise and the questionable appeal of the male lead) we have a main character who finds a means of time travel and enjoys a day (or night?) over and over.
                                    The twist? <em>This time the lead role is a lady.</em> She falls in love with the male lead and stuff happens.
                                    Honestly, I'm into it. 
                                    Even if the trailer leads me to believe they literally just swapped the problematic possessive male role, for a female one.
                                    Despite the fairly mixed reviews, it seems fun.

                                    <em>Meet Cute</em> and <em>When We First Met</em> eased us out of the traditional loop formula, and so now we easy out of the romance part as well.
                                    Well, mostly, there is definitely a romance part to this but, I think it's more about temporal hang-over hijinks.

                                    It's done in the "One Shot" style, same style as 1917 but without all the pesky war trauma.
                                    Centers around a guy who has a computer monitor that can see two minutes into the future.

                                    I've never been graced with the pleasure of watching this movie, but like many people I'm aware of it via pop-culture osmoses.

                                    I remember being in highschool when this came out and thinking it was just a brilliant but tragic depiction of our future.
                                    This one involves time travel in much the same way the show <em>Futurama</em> does. Which is to say, it's an accident.
                                    It's a pretty solid satire of how stupid seems to rise to the top, and what that future might look like.
                                    I'm not going to say it was wrong, but it <em>is</em> parody.
                                    But then, so is <em>The Simpsons</em> and they've hit a few too many nails on the head.
                                    In any case, it's a funny little one-way time travel adventure with Luke Wilson, the second best Wilson brother.

                            Look, I enjoy a good romance, but good is something these movies <em>are not</em>.
                            So the two in here are one that I don't like but is too well known to leave off the list, and the other is quite possibly the only well reviewed movie of it's class.

                                    I would like to be <em>very</em> clear, this is on here because it is a pretty well known one and not because I think it's good.
                                    Because it isn't. I just feel like it's a pretty iconic example of the time-travel + romance mash-up. 
                                    It's the story of Rachel McAdams falling

                                    This one comes with the endorsement of my partner, I never saw it.
                                    She said it was fun and cute, which are two words she rarely uses in a positive light when it comes to movies.
                                    For the second time in a row on this list, Rachel McAdams plays a woman with the terrible luck of dating a time traveler.

                                    Ok, this goes into the Honorable Mentions because while time travel is a topic it's not a core component of the plot.
                                    Well, it is, but in a less direct mechanical fashion. I really enjoyed this one, it's a little slow but if you like Jake Johnson or Aubrey Plaza you'll like this.
                                    And if you don't like them, I think you might need therapy. <a class="therapy" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=denver+colorado+therapist" target="_blank">Look into that.</a>

                                    Neither a comedy, nor a romance. But man, I love this movie.
                                    More due to nostalgia than anything else.
                                    It just oozes angst in the best 4th dimensional way possible.
                                    A mild mind fuck, and just a weird ride.
                                    The sequel to it (<em>S Darko</em>) was not as good, but it certainly wasn't awful.

                                    I really loved this show, and it's only in the Honorable Mentions category because it's a show and not a movie.
                                    Natasha Lyonne is, as always, a force to be reckoned with in this show.
                                    If you haven't watched it yet, all I have to say to you is: <em>why do you hate life?</em>

                                    Last, but no means least (<em>that would be Time Traveler's Wife</em>) this one is down here because it isn't really a romance or comedy.
                                    It deals with the time loop and death, but rather than a silly plucky adventure, it's used as a means to address a <em>pretty obvious</em> political issue.
                                    I feel like it manages to do it well, and it does so in a little over half an hour.
                                    If you've got a lunch break that you don't want to feel super cheery after, give it a watch.
